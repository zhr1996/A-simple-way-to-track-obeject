# A-simple-way-to-track-obeject
This is a quick way to track colored object
Thanks to Kyle Hounslow for his wonderful tutorial. I runned his code and found it worked pretty well. So I followd his step in his video 
and write on my own without consulting his code.
I used Canny to detect edges and use findContours to find out the oulines of object.
